Disclaimer of Warranty and Exclusive Remedies 
THE PROGRAMS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. WE FURTHER DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS AND IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. 

IN NO EVENT SHALL WE BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA OR DATA USE, INCURRED BY YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION IN CONTRACT OR TORT, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

Additional Trial Programs
We may include additional trial programs with your download of the Programs licensed under this agreement. You will have 30 days from the delivery date to evaluate these additional trial programs.

Any additional trial programs are provided "as is" and we do not provide technical support or any warranties for these programs.

No Technical Support 
Our technical support organization will not provide technical support, phone support, or updates to you for the programs licensed under this agreement. 

End of Agreement 
You may terminate this Agreement by destroying all copies of the programs. We have the right to terminate your right to use the programs if you fail to comply with any of the terms of this Agreement, in which case you shall destroy all copies of the programs. 

Relationship Between the Parties 
The relationship between you and us is that of licensee/licensor. Neither party will represent that it has any authority to assume or create any obligation, express or implied, on behalf of the other party, nor to represent the other party as agent, employee, franchisee, or in any other capacity. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to limit either party's right to independently develop or distribute software that is functionally similar to the other party's products, so long as proprietary information of the other party is not included in such software. 

Open Source 
"Open Source" software - software available without charge for use, modification and distribution - is often licensed under terms that require the user to make the user's modifications to the Open Source software or any software that the user 'combines' with the Open Source software freely available in source code form. If you use Open Source software in conjunction with the programs, you must ensure that your use does not: (i) create, or purport to create, obligations of us with respect to the Oracle programs; or (ii) grant, or purport to grant, to any third party any rights to or immunities under our intellectual property or proprietary rights in the Oracle programs. For example, you may not develop a software program using an Oracle program and an Open Source program where such use results in a program file(s) that contains code from both the Oracle program and the Open Source program (including without limitation libraries) if the Open Source program is licensed under a license that requires any "modifications" be made freely available. You also may not combine the Oracle program with programs licensed under the GNU General Public License ("GPL") in any manner that could cause, or could be interpreted or asserted to cause, the Oracle program or any modifications thereto to become subject to the terms of the GPL. 

Other 
Upon 45 days written notice Oracle may audit the use of the program. You agree to cooperate with Oracle's audit and provide reasonable assistance and access to information. You agree that Oracle shall not be responsible for any of your costs incurred in cooperating with the audit. 

Entire Agreement 
You agree that this Agreement is the complete Agreement for the programs and licenses, and this Agreement supersedes all prior or contemporaneous Agreements or representations. If any term of this Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain effective.
